# rl_dyn_prog
Class for solving a markov decision process (grid world). Uses policy iteration in a markov decision
process to find the optimal policy for finding the shortest path to one of two terminal states.
For visualization purpose the grid class is used. In the upper left corner of a field the value of the
value function is shown while colored lines visualize the belonging policy.
